## Instructions

This is a game similar to that of concentration. The object of the game is to find all the pairs in the least amount of moves. In order to find pairs, you'll have to click on the cards to reveal their symbol. Two card reveals equal one move. Once a pair has been identified, the pair of cards will remain shown. The more moves you make, the less amount of stars you'll end with.

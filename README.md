## Instructions

To run the application, start by clicking on one of the cards. This is a game similar to that of concentration. The object of the game is to find all the pairs in the least amount of moves. In order to find pairs, you'll have to click on the cards to reveal their symbol. Two card reveals equal one move. Once a pair has been identified, the pair of cards will remain shown. Once all pairs are identified, a window will pop up with your score. The more moves you make, the less amount of stars you'll end with. To reset the game at any time, click on the refresh arrow.
